      vars:
        - dHH_H1_regmass

labels:
   ### type can be `simple`, `custom`
   ### [option 1] use `simple` for binary/multi-class classification,
   ### then `value` is a list of 0-1 labels
   type: simple
   value: [isSignal, isBackground]
   # Note: the custom DisCo network is so far only implemented for binary classification,
   # while the weaver framework inherently assumes multi-classification.
   # Hence the list above must have exactly two elements,
   # but only the first element will be considered the binary labels
   # (with 1 for signal and 0 for background);
   # the second element is needed for syntax but ignored in the custom training loop.

observers:
  # Make sure the decorrelated variable is used as observer,
  # to make post-training conclusions.
  - dHH_H1_regmass
  - dHH_H2_regmass

weights:
   ### [option 2] compute weights on-the-fly using reweighting histograms
   #use_precomputed_weights: false
   #reweight_basewgt: np.ones(len(genWeight))
   #reweight_method: flat
   #reweight_threshold: 0
   #reweight_vars:
   #   dHH_H1_regmass: [75., 175.]
   # note: the reweight_vars are needed for syntax.
   #       in case only reweighting of total number of events is required,
   #       not binned in a specific variable,
   #       just use any variable with a single bin with large enough range
   #       (e.g. njets: [-1, 1000])
   #reweight_classes: [isSignal, isBackground]
   #class_weights: [1, 1]
