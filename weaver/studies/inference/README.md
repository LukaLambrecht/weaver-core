# Do model inference

Use case: model is trained and evaluated on signal samples + synthetic data.
Now want to check how it performs on (a small sample of) actual data,
before committing to run the full analysis chain.

Maybe also evaluate the model on QCD (and ttbar) simulation,
to see if it is strongly different from data and/or synthetic data.
